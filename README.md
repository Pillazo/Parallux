The light was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360, but any STEP editor will work. The step file is zipped because the full thing is 250gb-ish

The hardware was designed in KiCad 9.0

The software is arduino IDE, I used ESP32 and Teensy for the microcontrollers

The DMX controller software, which is more sACN anyways, was written in VB.NET
